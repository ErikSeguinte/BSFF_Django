<p>Every life has a story. Is a story.

And some are smaller.

Some stories are of individual lives, personal tragedies and triumphs. Of people, just trying to get by. Trying to create identity, or understanding, or peace, or family in the chaos of the universe.

Trying to create breathing space.

But the Sol system has a lot of space.

These are stories of the individuals that live in that system, and the frontiers they explore to find their space.</p>
